            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Travel Smarter: The Backpack That Doubles as a Mobile Office</h1><p>Our pals at This is Ground recently launched a "smart" backpack that will make you feel like the coolest, most in-the-know traveler out there. Crossing town (or the globe) with a laptop, iPad, headphones, and WiFi port can weigh you down - but it's a reality for many, especially those who work from the road.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e22f9a492a4d7f602c89eee545449af90da0d5de.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Light's L16 Pocket-Sized Multi-Aperture Camera</h1><p>No other camera looks quite like the newly announced Light L16, with one side featuring a whopping 16 lenses. This visual assessment immediately reveals just how advanced the technology is within the device. When capturing an image, all lenses fire at different focal lengths and a computational software within the camera assembles them to maximize every pixel.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3a15091274eec7069ecc73315c0d0bf176c8c5ea.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>eero: No More Internet Dead Zones</h1><p>Nearly all homes have a WiFi dead zone: you never get messages in the kitchen, you can't watch Netflix in the bedroom, you can't FaceTime in the backyard. This is simply because most of us have one WiFi router for our entire home, and that just doesn't work for how we use Internet today.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75956575966b1c70c11ff614cb972cd2133a6a9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Tesla Will Destroy the Automobile Industry</h1><p>If there's an example of a company about to disruptively innovate an entire industry, it's Tesla. Partly, this is because of raw technology--Tesla's is clearly superior to that of its competitors. Partly, it's because Tesla has a more efficient business model. As Slate recently pointed out, Tesla bypasses value-subtracting dealer franchises and universally disliked car salespeople.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/967786c4c9a099ae3d4e342800c9901098d0268b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>7 Pimm's Cup recipes for spring.</h1><p>If Spring had an official cocktail, the Pimm's Cup would be it. It's ultra-refreshing, bright and vibrant-and as easy to make as it is to drink. To mix a basic version of the classic British cocktail, all you need is Pimm's No. 1, ginger ale (or some sort of lemon-lime soda), cucumber and lemon.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/81e7943555bcd38f0d3a304708ede962df3f224f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
